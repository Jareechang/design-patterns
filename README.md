## Design patterns

playing around with some design patterns 


### Factory pattern

Defines a interface for creating objects, but let subclasses decide which class to
instantiate.

useful when:  

- Generating different instances of objects (depending on environment we're in)
- Objects or components that share properties  
- Composing objects with instances of other objects
